# Hao Sun — GitHub Pages Site

This is a minimal Jekyll site matching the demo you approved. It works with **GitHub Pages** (no custom build needed).

## Quick start

1. Create a new repo named `<your-username>.github.io` (or use your existing pages repo).
2. Download the zip from ChatGPT and extract it.
3. Copy all files to the repo root and commit.
4. In the repo settings → Pages: set source to `main` branch `/ (root)` and save.
5. Visit `https://<your-username>.github.io` in a minute.

### Optional: GitHub Actions + advanced plugins (jekyll-scholar)

If you want auto-generated publications from a BibTeX file, enable Actions and replace the site build with the provided workflow. Then add a `Gemfile` and `_data/pubs.bib`, and a Scholar-enabled `publications/index.md`.

See `actions/` folder in this zip for example files and config.
